<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
start       contents            end

There are some elements tha are called empty elements, which do not have end tags
such as <b>

All HTML elements can have attributes
The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element


The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document
The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

-When using CSS, we can specify a "class" name to it so that when we i.e we want to separate different types of divs individually
we can then say: 
<div class="div-1"></div>
<div class="div-2"></div>
<div class="div-3"></div>

And apply them in CSS:
.div-1 {
  background-color: blue; 
  height: 50px;
  width: 50px;
}
   
.div-2 {
  background-color: red; 
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
}
   
.div-3 {
  background-color: yellow; 
  height: 200px;
  width: 200px;
}
