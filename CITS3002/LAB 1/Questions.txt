     What do you observe and why?
        Initially, there are a lot of numbers which I don't understand.
        However, after implementing the function properly I can observe properly what is going on.
        Essentially, the value of each bit changes when we change or replace particular values within the bit
        ie:  
        the original value of the first entry is -50 0xffffffce but when swapped, produces: 
        -822083585      0xceffffff
    Does program od help?
        I am not sure how this helps, will need to clarify with the lab.
    What does my observations have for computer networking?
        From my understanding, if a bit sent and becomes altered, corrupted or changed, will completely change
        the value of the data that is being sent, thus giving the wrong data to the reciever. There will need to
        be some sort of way to verify and confirm that the data requested is the data that is recieved
